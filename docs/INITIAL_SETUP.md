- Head over to [Apple's developer console](https://developer.apple.com/). Click `Account` in the nav bar at the top. You will either have to sign in, or create an account. Your account dashboard ought to look like this. If you do not see `Certificates, IDs & profiles` as an option in the left-hand sidebar, it means you have not yet enrolled in the [Apple developer program](https://developer.apple.com/programs/) which is a prerequisite for Apple product development.
